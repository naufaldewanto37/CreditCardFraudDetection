# CreditCardFraudDetection
This project is a machine learning-based fraud detection system for credit card transactions.It leverages data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification models to identify potentially fraudulent transactions with high accuracy.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Credit card fraud is a major concern for financial institutions and customers.This project focuses on:

Identifying fraudulent transactions in a dataset using supervised learning.

Applying data balancing techniques to handle highly imbalanced datasets.

Evaluating different classification models based on metrics such as ROC AUC, precision, and recall.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset

Source: [Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

Contains 284,807 transactions with:

Time: Seconds elapsed between each transaction.

V1â€“V28: PCA-transformed features for confidentiality.

Amount: Transaction amount.

Class: Target variable (0 = legitimate, 1 = fraud).

Class distribution:

Legitimate: 99.83%

Fraud: 0.17%

| Model               | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | ROC AUC |
